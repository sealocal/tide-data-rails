#tide-data-rails (TideData.com)

A web app for finding high and low tides for a given day and location.


##Purpose
This app allows users to select a US Coastal location and a date; the app displays that date's high and low tide for that location. The date can be changed, and an Ajax request displays the corresponding tides.

##Languages
This app was built using Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, XML, and JSON.

##History
This repo contains the future of the [TideData.com](http://tidedata.com) app. TideData was originally an HTML/CSS/JS/PHP app, converted to a Rails app in April 2014. You can find the original version of this project at the [TideData](http://github.com/sealocal/TideData) repo.
